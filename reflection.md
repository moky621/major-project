Answer questions like the following: 

what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

I would probably tell myself to try to fix problems in a different way if I don't know how to do it. For example, I didn't know how to use the timeout function properly. I was planning on making a delay so you can see the explosion animation and then the game over screen. However, I decided to just display the game over screen when the UFO hits the ground. I would've also told myself to learn the p5play library a little better. I spent a lot of time trying to get my animations to run properly.

did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

Yes everything is done

What was the hardest part of the project?

The hardest part of the project was probably first starting out using p5play. It was brand new to me and I couldn't even get it to work in the first place. Over time, I got better at it and found myself being able to troubleshoot and fix my own code. p5play has a lot of things to learn like animations, sprites, groups, etc, but I eventually figured it out.

Were there any problems you could not solve?

I tried displaying instructions/controls on the side, so the player can read it before they play. However, I tried for a while and couldn't get it to work because the text wouldn't display properly. I tried making a sprite and placing the text inside the sprite, but I didn't like how that turned out either. I just ended up working on other parts of my project and never got back to that.
